Napa Valley, Calif., Linux Foundation Membership Summit, November 2, 2021 â€” The Linux Foundation, the nonprofit organization enabling mass innovation through open source, today announced the [NextArch Foundation](http://nextarch.io). The new Foundation is a neutral home for open source developers and contributors to build next-generation architecture that can support compatibility between an increasing array of microservices. 

API7 participated in the foundation's preparatory work and became the first batch of co-founders and supporters with more than 40 companies and institutions, including Tencent, Baidu, Jingdong, China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT), and Nanjing University.

With the wide application of cloud-native, big data, blockchain and other technologies under various  industries, enterprises' demand for governance of new technologies is getting stronger. In addition, they also need industry solutions, integration solutions, hard and soft integration architecture, etc. to solve the problems of scaling and commercialization, but there is not a mature open source ecology to cope with it.

Based on this background, the NextArch Foundation was born. It will gather upstream and downstream technical resources from Linux Foundation and TARS Foundation, and aggregate multi-dimensional resources from global IT companies and open source native enterprises to solve the problems of difficult compatibility between framework protocols and high threshold of component usage in heterogeneous scenarios, in order to meet the needs of enterprises for new business and new scenarios in the future. 

API7 CEO Ming Wen said, Communicating with enterprises, we find that enterprises often have concerns that after deploying critical services to operators, they can not foresee the technology trend in 3~5 years or even longer. Therefore, there is an urgent need for enterprises to have a forward-looking organization or foundation to plan the technology development route, and NextArch Foundation The NextArch Foundation was born.

### The challenges of developing a "next architecture"

In recent years, the term "next generation" or "next-generation" has been derived in the context of technology evolution. This is not limited to new technology architectures, data storage, heterogeneous hardware, R&D performance, network communications, audio and video, etc. As global technology development accelerates further, new concepts mature and the technology stack changes almost every three years.

As a result, developers need to incur significant learning costs to find the best tool for their development needs among a wide range of tools and solutions. For example, in a Forrester insight study on cloud-native developers in August, 72 percent of more than 400 respondents said they needed more business and industry knowledge in the face of rapidly changing market conditions, and 66 percent said changes in enterprise technology architectures were driving their need for more comprehensive skills. At the same time, most enterprises are not agile enough in their IT architecture and lack their own technology development capabilities to meet the demands of digital transformation to respond quickly to business needs. This can be seen in the results of this research on digital strategy launched by McKinsey this year.

For the development of "next-generation architecture", there are some common problems and challenges for enterprises at the technical level, industry level and to promote commercialization.

- In the process of improving R&D efficiency through automation tools, enterprises face difficulties in compatibility with multiple components in heterogeneous and multi-cloud environments, difficulties in interoperability between different framework protocols, and lack of convenient or unified multi-cloud management tools.
- Various industries face diverse challenges in open source, integration, adaptation, ecology and technical shortcomings, and traditional industries face the dilemma of large and difficult transformation span in upgrading and reengineering to the dimension of "wisdom" and "intelligence".
- In promoting commercialization, there are problems of how to combine the technical architecture with business and reflect the potential of commercial application, and how to rely on the new technical architecture or technical re-engineering to enable the change of enterprise business model.

The Next  Architecture will leverage automated development tools and solution development processes designed for next-generation architectures to enhance the efficiency of R&D teams and reduce their learning and management costs. Enterprises will also be provided with easy-to-use, efficient and cost-effective tools to address productization and commercialization issues in their digital transformation process.

### NextArch Foundation's solution

"Next Architectures" exist in almost all domains and iterations such as communication, database, storage, cloud-native, Serverless, AR/VR, quantum computing, Telematics, silicon, etc.

Currently, the number of open source projects that focus on and address Next Generation Architecture continues to grow and accelerate their adoption. For industries, enterprises and open source projects eager to develop "next generation architecture", NextArch Foundation will help accelerate the iteration of their technologies, further improve the quality of open source code of open source projects, build a more suitable open platform to promote the construction and development of open source communities, enrich the application scenarios, and guide enterprises and industries to explore more suitable commercialization paths. NextArch Foundation will help accelerate the iteration of their technologies, further improve the quality of open source code, build a more suitable open platform to promote the construction and development of open source communities, enrich application scenarios, and guide enterprises and industries to explore more appropriate commercialization paths.

Targeting a wide range of technologies and industries, the NextArch Foundation will focus on the evolution, application and commercialization of technologies such as CI/CD, cloud, containers and virtualization, data and analytics, DevOps, IoT, network communications and edge computing, open hardware, storage, web and application development, as well as new application solutions and integrated solutions for different industries such as IoT, gaming, healthcare, entertainment, retail, and communications.

For example, in the field of communication, in order to meet the future 6G richer business applications and extreme performance requirements, NextArch Foundation will explore new network architectures and strive to achieve breakthroughs in key core technologies; in the field of hardware, to solve the problem of limited open source community due to few users, few contributors and unclear framework structure; in the field of big data, to build a unified database supporting OLTP and OLAP to reduce the cost of maintaining different database management and maintenance. In the field of big data, we will build a unified database supporting OLTP and OLAP to reduce the cost of management and maintenance for enterprises maintaining different databases; around the next-generation data storage technology, we will build a stable and efficient data storage system to meet the needs of future business development, etc.

### The Future of NextArch Foundation

As Jim Zemlin, Executive Director of the Linux Foundation, mentioned, developers need to choose between different infrastructures and the right tools to solve various problems, and this choice is often difficult.

With regard to the new technologies and areas that the NextArch Foundation is currently focusing on, Mike Dolan, senior vice president and general manager of programs at the Linux Foundation, said, "The NextArch Foundation understands that solving the biggest technology challenge of our time is building an open open source ecosystem and fostering collaboration between companies in the ecosystem. This is a mission-critical endeavor that can only be done in the open source community, and the Linux Foundation is pleased to support the growth of this community and provide referenceable open governance practices for building its ecosystem."

As an advisor to the NexrArch Foundation, Ibrahim Haddad, Executive Director of LF AI & Data Foundation, also said, "It is a pleasure to be involved with the NextArch Foundation in an advisory capacity. Over the past five years, we have witnessed significant advances in various technology areas such as cloud, AI, IoT, AR/VR, quantum computing, serverless computing, and more. These advances have fueled the creation and development of a great deal of open source software. But one of the central challenges is being able to connect these technologies and software assets under a single, next-generation architecture that supports diverse computing environments and enables enterprise digital transformation. nextArch Foundation will be at the heart of this effort, building a community and establishing an ecosystem that brings organizations and communities together to address this challenge in an open environment. "

In the future, the NextArch Foundation will build an open source ecosystem of next-generation architectures suitable for enterprise development and promote technological innovation and business growth through an open and neutral governance model.
